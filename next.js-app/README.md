# Next.js Back-End API

- In this API directory, we can create api endpoints that are executed exclusively on the backend.
- The Next.js App contains the following routes/endpoints:
  1. `/api/` - `POST` :
  2. `/api/` - `GET` :

#

- Each Next.js page component allows us to fetch data server-side thanks to a function called `getStaticProps`. When this function is called, the initial page load is rendered server-side, which is great for SEO. The page doesn't render until this function completes.
