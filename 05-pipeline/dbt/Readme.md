# Introduction to DBT

- **dbt** is a transformation workflow that allows any business analyst comfortable with SQL to design and implement their own **data transformations**.

- **Benefits of dbt** include:

  1. **SQL-Based Transformation**: dbt lets you write transformation logic directly in SQL, a language familiar to most data analysts and engineers. It lets you create discrete data models, transforming raw data into target datasets while organizing and materializing frequently used business logic efficiently.
  2. **Jinja for Enhanced SQL Functionality**:
     - **dbt** uses **Jinja**, a lightweight templating language, to extend SQL functionality.
     - You can leverage control structures like For Loops to simplify repetitive queries.
     - Reusable SQL code can be shared through macros, reducing redundancy.
     - With Jinja, dbt effectively turns your project into a SQL programming environment.
  3. Ref and Dependency Management
     - The `ref` function in dbt allows you to control the execution order of models, ensuring dependencies are handled seamlessly.
     - dbt acts as an orchestration layer on top of your data warehouse, pushing all calculations to the database level. This ensures faster, more secure, and easier maintenance of the transformation process.
  4. **Data Snapshots**: **dbt** provides a snapshot feature that captures raw data at specific points in time. This is particularly useful for reconstructing past values and tracking historical changes.
  5. **Testing and Data Integrity**: **dbt** simplifies data quality checks by enabling:
     - Built-in tests for data integrity and validation.
     - Custom tests are driven by business logic and are applied directly within YAML configuration files.
     - Assertions about test results to improve SQL model accuracy.
  6. **Automated Scheduling**: **dbt** automates the scheduling of production refreshes at user-defined intervals, ensuring data is always up-to-date and reliable.
  7. **Version Control and Documentation**
     - With Git-enabled version control, dbt allows seamless collaboration and project versioning.
     - It auto-generates model documentation that is easy to share with stakeholders and clearly shows dependencies and logic.
  8. **Community and Open-Source Ecosystem**
     - **dbt** is open-source and supported by an extensive library of resources, including installation guides, FAQs, and reference documents.
     - Access to **dbt packages** allows users to leverage prebuilt models and macros to solve common problems efficiently.

- **Disadvantages of dbt**
  1. You still need data integration tools to extract and load data from multiple sources to your data warehouse, as dbt only takes care of the transformation part in ELT.
  2. Compared to tools offering a GUI, dbt is less user-friendly as it is SQL-based.
  3. You need sufficient technical expertise when you need to make changes to the boilerplate code at the backend.
  4. To keep the data transformation process as readable as possible in the UI, your data engineers must keep it clean and comprehensible.

# dbt Cloud vs dbt Core

- **dbt Core** is a free, open-source, command-line tool that enables users to design their data models using SQL. It then converts these models into optimized SQL code that can be executed on data warehouses or other data storage systems.
- **dbt Cloud** is a cloud-based solution that offers additional features and capabilities in addition to those offered by dbt Core. It provides a web interface for managing data models and also includes scheduling options, collaboration tools, and integrations with other data tools.
