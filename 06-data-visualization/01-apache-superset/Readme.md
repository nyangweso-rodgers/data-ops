# Apache Superset

- **Apache Superset** as its name, coming from Apache Software Foundation, which is a non-organization profit that focus on open-source project software. It is the top-level project licensed by Apache 2.0.
- Superset provides non-code interface for building charts. However, it is included SQL query that can save data in Superset database table that can be used for data visualization too.

# Unique Functions in Superset

1. Superset Database with SQL Query

   - Data from many sources include PostgreSQL, Google BigQuery, and Amazon Redshift can be saved in Superset Database. It is provided by Superset that can make the user collecting many sources. The data can be shown in the SQL Query which can make the datasets connected each other. The connected datasets that created by SQL Query have to be saved as a table if the user want to use it as data visualization. The user can save the SQL Query too for later used which may be the user want to edit part of query to create another table later.

2. A Table for A Data Visualization
   -  Using SQL Query if you want to combine many tables is required. Superset only accepts one table for one data visualization. It is shown all tables that saved in Superset Database, but the visualization only accept one table. Therefore, if the user wants to use data from many tables that connect many tables, the user has to create the table and save it in Superset Database first before creating data visualization or the user only use the table for the visualization itself and then combine with another visualization in a dashboard to make a comprehensive data insight.
