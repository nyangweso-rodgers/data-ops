# About the Dashboard

- Develop a data dashboard with a source data from a single csv file containing 100,000 synthetic sales records.
- Dashboard sections:
  1. The top row enables the user to select specific start and end dates and/or product categories using date pickers and a drop-down list, respectively.
  2. The second row, **“Key Metrics**,“ provides a top-level summary of the selected data.
  3. The **Visualisations** section allows the user to select one of three graphs to display the input dataset.
  4. The **Raw Data** section is exactly what it claims to be. This tabular representation of the chosen data effectively views the underlying CSV data file.

# Source Data

- Python code to generate the data:
