# What is Taipy?

- **Taipy** an open-source Python library for building production-ready front-end & back-end in no time. No knowledge of web development is required!
- The target audience for **Taipy** is data scientists, machine learning practitioners and data engineers who may not have extensive experience developing front-end applications, but are typically fluent in Python. Taipy makes it reasonably easy to create front-ends using Python, so that’s a win-win.

# Taipy vs. Gradio vs. Streamlit?

- While **Gradio** excels at quickly creating ML demos and **Streamlit** is brilliant for interactive data exploration, they both operate on a principle of simplicity that can become a limitation as your application’s ambition grows. **Taipy** enters the picture when your project needs to graduate from a simple script or demo into a robust, performant, and maintainable application.
- You should strongly consider choosing **Taipy** over Streamlit/Gradio if:

  1. Your app’s performance is critical
  2. Your single script file is becoming unmanageably long and complex.
  3. You need to build multi-page applications with complex navigation.
  4. Your application requires “what-if” scenario analysis or complex pipeline execution.
  5. You are building a production tool for business users, not just an internal exploratory dashboard.
  6. You are working in a team and need a clean, maintainable codebase.

- Remark: choose **Gradio** for demos. Choose **Streamlit** for interactive exploration. Choose **Taipy** when you’re ready to build high-performance, scalable, and production-grade enterprise data applications.
